# Automated Notes Maker from Recordings
Project aims to design an automated notes maker system that converts audio recordings into concise and accurate text based notes.
Today speech technologies are commonly available for a limited but interesting range of tasks. The technologies enable machines to respond correctly and reliably to human voices and provide useful and valuable services. As communicating with a computer is faster using voice rather than using a keyboard, people will prefer such a system. Communication among human beings is dominated by spoken language, therefore it is natural for people to expect voice interfaces with computers can be accomplished by developing a voice recognition system - speech-to-text which allows the computer to translate voice requests and dictation into text. 

The process of converting an acoustic signal that is recorded using a microphone to a set of words is known as voice recognition system - speech-to-text. The data that was recorded can be utilized to create documents. The goal of the project is to create an automated notes creator from recordings using an AI and ML-based application that can translate spoken commands into text and subsequently PDF/WORD format.
